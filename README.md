# Translator: A Console Dictionary

## Features
* Use Azure cognitive services to build dictionary query function.

* Once you query a word (with specified `from` and `to`), it would save the result in local db (Key-Value base) instead of
 query from cognitive services everytime to waste bandwidth.

* Multiple language-supported


## Requirements
* Only `$AZURE_COGNITIVE_SERVICE_KEY` and `$AZURE_COGNITIVE_SERVICE_ENDPOINT` environment variables are needed.
